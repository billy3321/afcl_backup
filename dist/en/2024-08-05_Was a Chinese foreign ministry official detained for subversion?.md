## A claim emerged in Chinese-language social media posts that China had detained a vice foreign minister, Hua Chunying, in July over charges of subversion.

## But the claim is false. Hua has continued public activities, including on social media following her alleged detention. Keyword searches found no credible reports about Hua’s arrest. The same claim has circulated online since as early as 2018.

The claim was [shared](https://x.com/zhihui999/status/1813055608888652210) on X, formerly known as Twitter, on July 15, 2024.

“Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying was detained by police earlier over charges of subversion,” the claim reads in part.

“The police found about five million U.S. dollars, which is equivalent to about 31 million Chinese yuan at her house,” it reads further.

The claim was shared alongside an image of Hua with Chinese text attached on the right side.

The same claim and image were shared on X [here](https://x.com/9IGLRuDobZqKvaO/status/1812749165031743707) and [here](https://x.com/fang_danie121/status/1812766248033460601).

But the claim is false.

## Old claim

The claim addresses Hua as Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, but Hua was promoted to vice minister on May 27, 2024.

A combined keyword search and reverse image search found similar claims circulated online as early as February 2018.

The approximate conversion rate of 6.3% aligns with the exchange rate between dollars and yuan in February 2018, rather than the current exchange rate of around 7.2%, which would result in approximately 36 million yuan – which could indicate that the text was written in 2018, not in 2024.

## Recent activities

The last time Hua's name was [mentioned](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/web/wjb_673085/zygy_673101/hcy1/) by the foreign ministry was on May 21, when she [received](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/web//wjb_673085/zzjg_673183/ldmzs_673663/xwlb_673665/202405/t20240521_11308493.shtml) a delegation of visiting young scholars from several Latin American think tanks.

Hua’s official X account has remained active since her supposed detainment on July 15, with 15 posts published in the week following the appearance of the latest rumors.
