## A video has been shared in Chinese-language social media posts that claim it shows a U.S. fighter jet crashing.

## But the claim is false. The video in fact shows a crash of private aircraft produced by the Soviet Union for export in the late 1960s.

The video was [shared](https://archive.ph/qxhk5#selection-577.0-577.43) on X on Feb. 2.

“Another plane has crashed again! Could it be that the ‘Beacon Nation’ has developed a seventh-generation fighter jet, and since the hangars are full, they need to destroy some of the old stock?,” the caption of the video reads, referring to the United States.

The 26-second video shows two pilots parachuting out of a low-flying plane before it crashes.

U.S. aircraft crashes have become a hot topic on Chinese-language social media following recent accidents including a F-35 fighter jet that [crashed](https://www.eielson.af.mil/News/Display/Article/4047595/press-release-f-35-aircraft-crash-update/) in Alaska during training on Jan. 28, a military helicopter [crashing](https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/plane-crash-dca-potomac-washington-dc-01-29-25/index.html) into a commercial airplane over Washington on Jan. 29 and a medical plane [crashing](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/small-plane-crashes-near-philadelphia-mall-multiple-casualties-ground-reports-2025-02-01/) into a Philadelphia neighborhood on Jan. 31.

The Detroit News, among [other](https://theaviationist.com/2023/08/14/privately-owned-mig-23-crashes-during-airshow-in-michigan/) media outlets, [reported](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2023/08/13/plane-crashes-during-airshow-finale-at-willow-run/70563452007/) the incident at that time, saying the video was genuine and the incident occurred at an airshow titled “Thunder Over Michigan.”

The reports pointed out that the aircraft was not a U.S. army fighter plane but a privately owned [MiG-23](https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/1162493/mikoyan-gurevich-mig-23ms-flogger-e/) jet.
