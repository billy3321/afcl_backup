# Does a viral online video show Ukrainian leader Zelenskyy dancing?

## Verdict: False

## A video has been circulated in Chinese-language social media posts that claim it shows the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dancing before he became his country’s leader.

## But the claim is false. The video, which has been digitally altered, in fact shows a Russian dancer who goes by the name “Vusaaal” on TikTok.

The 19-second video showing a man, who appears to be Zelenskyy in a red outfit dancing to fast music, was published on [Weibo](https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5136049715809377) and [X](https://x.com/Snofy8/status/1892362457139544233) on Feb. 20.

Social media users said the man seen in the video is indeed Zelenskyy, with some echoing online criticism about his past career as a comedian, thus not qualified to lead Ukraine.

Zelenskyy, who was a comedian, actor, and producer before becoming president, gained fame as the star of the popular Ukrainian television series Servant of the People, where he played a high school teacher who unexpectedly becomes president.

While his background in comedy and entertainment played a significant role in his rise to political office, critics mocked Zelenskyy for his lack of political experience, arguing that a comedian couldn’t lead a country effectively.

Some also pointed to his past performances, including satirical and risqué skits, claiming they were unpresidential, while others dismissed him as merely playing the role of a leader rather than being one, suggesting his presidency was an extension of his TV persona.

But the claim about the video is false.

A reverse image search of screenshots from the clip led to an identical video featuring a different man’s face, which was published by a TikTok user “[Vusaaal](https://www.tiktok.com/@vusaaal/video/7052410212015246593)” in January 2022.

Keyword searches found that the user “Vusaaal” is a Russian dancer who posts his videos on different social media channels.

Vusaaal [told](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/video-does-not-show-ukraines-president-zelenskiy-belly-dancing-2024-01-10/) the Reuters news agency in January 2024 that he was the man in the video.

Siwei Lyu, a professor of computer science at the State University of New York in Albany, also told Reuters that the online video featuring Zelenskyy dancing was an AI-generated deepfake, pointing to color and border discrepancies around the face as several commonly seen flaws in such videos.

The claim about the video has been also debunked by [AFP](https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.34EQ8F9) and India’s fact-checking organization [Boom](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-dancing-fake-news-24058).
