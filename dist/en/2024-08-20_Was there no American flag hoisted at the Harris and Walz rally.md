## A photo of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has been repeatedly shared in Chinese-language posts purporting to show that there was no American flag hoisted at their rally in early August.

## But the claim is false. A review of live footage of the rally shows that there were at least two American flags flying at the event.

The claim was [shared](https://x.com/GanchengW/status/1821029482234274196) on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Aug. 7, 2024.

“These two extreme left-wing communists didn’t even have an American flag at the rally,” reads the claim.

It was shared alongside a photo that shows Harris and Walz standing in front of a crowd.

The claim began to circulate online after Walz was announced on Aug. 6 as Democratic nominee Harris’ running mate for the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

But the claim is false. A reverse image search shows that the photo was taken at the duo’s initial campaign event in Pennsylvania on Aug. 6.

A separate search found a video clip that recorded the event [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deAOPOXjncc) on YouTube by Fox News.

A review of the video shows that there are at least two American flags hoisted at the event.

## Airport claim

Two photos of Harris and Walz getting off a plane were [shared](https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5066101866105706) by Chinese-speaking users on Weibo alongside a claim that they were digitally altered to add to the crowd, but in fact no one showed up to greet the duo.

But the claim is false. A google reverse image search found the photos were taken at the duo’s rally in Detroit on Aug. 7.

A separate search found the footage of the event published on YouTube by [PBS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVbLW6Xfbc), [Detroit Free Press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9DdAsQkghk) and [FOX News](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6360312188112).

A review of those videos shows that the crowd were genuine.
