# Fake images of US college protests circulate in China

## Images, including one of Mao's slogans, are from unrelated events months or years earlier.

## Pro-Palestinian protests on U.S. college campuses have gotten attention on Chinese social media, but some of these posts show unrelated demonstrations that happened months or even years earlier.

## One   [aerial video showing a massive gathering](https：//weibo.com/2110587294/ObQry1cjl)   of thousands of people packed together – purported to be at Columbia University in New York – is actually a demonstration in January in Hamburg, Germany, against a far-right political group.

[**Another photo**](https://archive.ph/lVnCD)   **claimed to show a protester holding up a famous Mao Zedong quote in Chinese, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." But Asia Fact Check Lab found this to be from a pro-gun rally held in Virginia in 2020.**

As the Israeli-Hamas conflict drags into its seventh month, student demonstrations supporting the Palestininans and calling for a cease-fire have spread across dozens of U.S. university campuses.

The aerial video of thousands gathered in public was [shared](https://weibo.com/2110587294/ObQry1cjl) on the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo on April 28, with the breathless caption: "U.S. university demonstration: Pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University is majestic!"

But a reverse image search found the video, [shared](https://www.tiktok.com/@diuhidiuhi/video/7326221805868338462) on TikTok Jan. 21, 2024, actually depicted 80,000 people in Hamburg, Germany, protesting against the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party "since their 'secret meeting' with the fascist Identitarian Movement was revealed.

Keyword searches including "AfD" found the Hamburg demonstrations were one amongst a series of protests to break out against the party after a [news report](https://correctiv.org/en/latest-stories/2024/01/15/secret-plan-against-germany/) surfaced that the group had considered a plan to expel all people of "non-German backgrounds" from the country, including immigrants who have already obtained residency at a meeting with influential leaders.

In another case, a number of [Weibo](https://archive.ph/lVnCD) [influencers](https://archive.ph/XkIdY) and X accounts also recently claimed that one protester at an unspecified college campus held up a poster with the Mao quote, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

But this is false. The photo is from a pro-gun rally held in Virginia in 2020, and has nothing to do with any pro-Palestine demonstration.

A reserve image search reveals that a version of the same image shown in a larger frame was published in an [article](https://k.sina.cn/article_1499104401_p595a849102700nbe9.html?from=mil) published on the Chinese military news blog Sina Military in 2020

Keyword searches using visual clues from the photo, including a banner that reads Constitutional Conservatives, found that it shows a [rally](https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-richmond-virginia-charlottesville-us-news-2c997c92fa7acd394f7cbb89882d9b5b) held by pro-gun advocates from all across the U.S. in Richmond in 2020.

A closer look at the image also shows a street sign reading “N. 9th St.” at the top of the frame. A search in Google Maps found that this was a street in Richmond and not part of the university campus.
